## What is LinuxQuest?

**LinuxQuest** is a CTF-style, story-driven Linux learning platform. Players learn real Linux administration — not through tutorials, but through mystery missions set across India, where every command is earned by needing it.

You don't study `kill`. You use it to stop a rogue process before it wipes a server.

**Learn by doing. Under pressure. In the dark.**

---

## The Interface — A Shell. Nothing Else.

There is no dashboard. No nav bar. No buttons. No login page.

The entire LinuxQuest frontend is a terminal. You navigate the platform the same way you navigate Linux — with commands. The app *is* a filesystem. You log in from the shell. You play from the shell. You check your leaderboard from the shell.

```

### Navigation Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `login` | Authenticate via Google OAuth — entirely in the shell |
| `ls` | List what's available here |
| `cd missions` | Browse campaigns |
| `cd antariksha` | Enter Operation Antariksha |
| `cd ch1` | Enter Chapter 1 — loads mission brief |
| `start` | Launch the sandboxed terminal for this chapter |
| `submit ANTARIKSHA{flag}` | Submit your flag |
| `cat profile` | View your XP, Elo, badges, streak |
| `cat leaderboard` | Global top-20 |
| `cat daily` | Today's daily challenge |
| `hint` | Use a hint (costs Elo) |
| `whoami` | Your username + Elo rank |
| `man shiva` | SHIVA lore — in `man` page format |
| `clear` | Clear the terminal |

Players learn `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, and `pwd` just by using the app — before a single mission starts.

## Authentication

Login happens entirely inside the shell. No separate login page. No forms.

```
guest@linuxquest:~$ login

Enter your Google account to continue:
> login @divyansh@gmail.com

Opening secure connection to accounts.google.com...
Authentication successful. [OK]

Welcome back, Arjun.
Elo: 1,247 | Rank: Power User | Streak: 4 days

arjun@linuxquest:~$ _
```

- **Google OAuth 2.0** — free, handles passwords, you own all the data
- **PostgreSQL database** — stores users, progress, XP, Elo, streaks, command history
- **Gmail SMTP** — welcome emails, weekly quest reminders, badge notifications (~500/day free)
- **JWT sessions** — issued after OAuth, stored in browser

---

## Progression System

Chapters are **strictly linear**. You cannot skip ahead.

```
arjun@linuxquest:~$ cd missions/antariksha/ch5

[ACCESS DENIED]
Chapter 5 — Permissions (Hyderabad) is locked.

Complete Ch 4 — Cronjob of Doom (Delhi) first.
Progress: Ch 1 ✓  Ch 2 ✓  Ch 3 ✓  Ch 4 ✗

arjun@linuxquest:~/missions/antariksha$ _
```

| Chapter state | `ls` shows | `cd ch<N>` does |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| ✅ Complete | `ch3/  [CLEARED]` | Enters freely — replay anytime |
| 🔓 Active | `ch4/  [ACTIVE]` | Enters normally |
| 🔒 Locked | `ch5/  [LOCKED]` | Returns ACCESS DENIED |

**Exception:** Ch 0 (Bootcamp) can be skipped by experienced players. Type `skip bootcamp` → 5-command validation test → if you pass, you're marked complete and jump directly to Ch 1.

---

## The Flagship Campaign — Operation Antariksha

You are **Arjun Sharma**, a junior ISRO engineer on your first week. A rogue AI designation **S.H.I.V.A** (Self-Healing Infiltration & Vulnerability Agent) has hijacked India's satellite network.

Armed with only a terminal, you must navigate compromised servers across the country, recover encrypted mission data, and shut SHIVA down before it triggers a cascading failure across India's digital infrastructure.

11 chapters. One city per server. Every command earned in context.

**Ending:** SHIVA goes offline. The satellite network comes back. Credits roll with your full command history — the exact sequence of 200+ commands that saved India.

---

## Bootcamp

Before Ch 1, every new player completes a mandatory 10-minute interactive Bootcamp in the shell.

```
🎯 Bootcamp Objectives

1. What is a terminal?
   → You'll type your first command: echo "hello"

2. Command structure
   → command [options] [arguments]
   → Try: ls -la /home

3. The help system
   → Use --help and man pages

4. Navigation basics
   → pwd, cd, ls
   → Find your way to /var/log

5. Creating and viewing files
   → touch, cat, echo
   → Create a file called "test.txt"

6. Pipes and redirection
   → | and >
   → Count the lines in /etc/passwd

No hints. No time limit. Just get comfortable.
```

Players who complete the Bootcamp earn the 🎓 **Terminal Cadet** badge.

## Standalone Tracks

| Track | Story Hook | Commands |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Shell Scripting** | SHIVA spreading via cron jobs across 100+ nodes | `bash`, `trap`, `set -e`, `getopts` |
| **Storage & Filesystems** | Corrupted satellite backup disk — recover telemetry | `df`, `mount`, `fsck`, `fdisk` |
| **Package Management** | Forensic toolkit missing. 8 minutes before SHIVA rotates keys | `apt`, `dnf`, `rpm`, `dpkg` |
| **Vim Basics** | Remote server. No nano. 15-minute window to edit launch config | `vim` — normal/insert/save |
| **Vim Mastery** *(panic mode)* | SSH drops every 30 seconds. Fix config before launch window closes | `vim` — macros, registers, visual |
| **Git** | Developer force-pushed to main. 3 weeks of satellite firmware gone. Recover it | `git reflog`, `cherry-pick`, `bisect` |
| **Docker** | SHIVA escaped into Docker containers. Find it. Kill it. Prevent restart | `docker ps`, `exec`, `logs`, `network` |
| **Kubernetes** *(advanced)* | SHIVA replicated across a live cluster. Isolate every instance | `kubectl get/logs/exec/taint` |
| **Environment Variables** | Launch codes stored as env vars. Recover without rebooting | `export`, `env`, `printenv`, `.env` |

---

## Difficulty Levels

| Mode | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Standard** | `grep "ERROR" anomaly.txt` |
| **Hard** | `grep -E "ERROR\|CRITICAL" /var/log/*.log \| sort \| uniq -c \| sort -rn \| head -20` |

Hard mode: 2× XP, exclusive badges, counts toward Elo rating.

---

## Daily Challenges

Like LeetCode's daily problem — but for Linux. Refreshes at midnight IST.

```
⚡ Command of the Day — grep

Mission: A 500MB nginx log at /var/log/nginx/access.log
Find:
  1. All requests returning 500
  2. The IP with the most errors
  3. The time window with the highest error rate

Time limit: none  |  Hints: none  |  Reward: +50 XP, daily streak
```

5–10 minutes. Keeps users coming back daily. Streak system like Duolingo.

---

## Weekly Quests

Every Friday 8 PM IST → Sunday 8 PM IST. A fresh, time-limited mission.
Everyone gets the same clean container and the same story. First to finish with the best score wins.

```
Weekly Quest #17 — "The Lost Satellite"
Difficulty: Hard   |   Window: Fri 8 PM → Sun 8 PM IST

Leaderboard
───────────────────────────────────────
#1  divyansh_v15     14m 22s   0 hints

#3  aman_iitb        18m 53s   0 hints
───────────────────────────────────────
```

Scoring: time × hint penalty × wrong-command penalty.
Past quests stay playable for practice — just not ranked.

## Objective Validation

Validators check **system state**, not keystrokes. The story advances automatically when the state matches. No submit button (except for CTF flags).

| Validator type | What it checks |
|----------------|---------------|
| `output_match` | Command output matches expected |
| `file_exists` | File created at correct path |
| `file_content` | File contains specific text |
| `permission_check` | File has correct chmod bits |
| `process_dead` | Process no longer running |
| `cron_absent` | Malicious cron entry removed |
| `service_state` | systemd unit is in expected state |
| `network_blocked` | Domain/IP unreachable from container |
| `script_runs` | Script executes without error, correct output |

All validators run server-side. Players never see the check logic.

---

## Sandbox Architecture

Every user gets their own ephemeral Linux container. Commands run for real.

```
User types command in browser terminal
    ↓
xterm.js → WebSocket → Go backend
    ↓
docker exec <container_id> <command>
    ↓
Output streams back via WebSocket → xterm.js
```

**Container constraints:**

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CPU | 0.5 core |
| RAM | 128 MB |
| Disk | 512 MB |
| Network | Blocked (Ch 9/10: simulated internal net only) |
| Idle timeout | 30 min → auto-destroy |

**Future:** Firecracker MicroVM migration — sub-125ms cold starts, stronger isolation at 1000+ concurrent users. `DockerDriver` and `FirecrackerDriver` share the same `SandboxManager` interface from day one. Swap the driver, zero architecture changes.

---

## Tech Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---------|--------|
| Terminal emulator | `xterm.js` + `xterm-addon-fit` |
| Frontend | React + Vite (TypeScript) |
| Backend | Go + Gin |
| Sandbox (v1) | Docker + Alpine Linux |
| Sandbox (future) | Firecracker MicroVMs |
| WebSocket | Native browser + Go goroutines |
| Auth | Google OAuth 2.0 (free) |
| Email | Gmail SMTP with App Password |
| DB | PostgreSQL (Supabase free tier) |
| Deployment | Hetzner VPS + Docker Compose |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Docker container escape | `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, drop all caps, read-only root FS |
| Container sprawl | 1 per user hard limit, 30 min idle → auto-destroy |
| `rm -rf /` inside container | Ephemeral — let it happen. Auto-recreate for next objective |
| Slow container startup | Pre-warmed pool; assign on session start |
| Cheating (inspecting validators) | All validators server-side only, never sent to client |
| Elo manipulation (alt accounts) | Rate-limit + email verification + IP fingerprinting |
| Chapter skipping | Strict linear progression gate in backend — `canAccessChapter()` check |
| Community campaign abuse | Review queue + sandboxed validator execution |

---

## Roadmap

| Phase | Goal | Timeline |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Phase 1 — MVP** | Bootcamp + Ch 1–3 + sandbox terminal + Google OAuth | 4–6 weeks |
| **Phase 2 — Core Platform** | Ch 4–8 + daily challenges + progress persistence + email notifications | 4 weeks |
| **Phase 3 — Competition Layer** | Ch 9–11 + Weekly Quests + Elo + leaderboard + profile cards | 3 weeks |
| **Phase 4 — Full Platform** | All tracks + Interview Mode + Team Battles + Community Campaigns + Firecracker | Ongoing |

---

## Other Campaigns

| Campaign | Premise | Focus |
